This week I built a Pin Board(Pinterest Clone) where signed in users can upload their favourite images. The Functionality includes: users signing in and out, image uploading, descriptions about the pins. To make the style floating I have used Masonry-Rails gem. Signed-in users can like the pins.

This week I have used haml instead of erb.

I will be deploying this to heroku soon.
